<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

### R3M Research Project

The R3M roject is dedicated to advancing adaptable and responsive manufacturing systems by leveraging cutting-edge robotics, AI, and automation. A key challenge in modern manufacturing is the inefficiency and high cost associated with reprogramming robotic systems to handle varying product demands. The R3M approach tackles this issue by developing algorithms capable of automatically generating configuration and programming data from product and process requirements, equipment specifications and CAD inputs, significantly reducing manual intervention.

ROS 2 has been the primary enabler for the reconfigurability and adaptability of the R3M system. By utilizing its modular architecture, real-time performance, and scalability, we have developed an automation framework that allows robotic systems to be dynamically reconfigured based on production demands. Through ROS 2’s distributed communication mechanisms, robotic cells can seamlessly integrate with external software and hardware components, ensuring interoperability across different manufacturers and setups. This integration is key to reducing downtime, improving efficiency, and enabling flexible automation, all of which are core objectives of the R3M Project.

The R3M Project is an EPSRC-funded UK research initiative (EP/V051180/1) focused on Reconfigurable Robotics for Responsive Manufacture. Led by Cranfield University, it is a collaborative effort involving Loughborough University, the University of Sheffield, and AMRC-Sheffield. Together, these institutions are working to develop next-generation, adaptable manufacturing systems that can dynamically respond to changing production needs while improving efficiency and reducing costs.

### R3M-APG Repository

The R3M-APG repository contains all the components required to execute, manage, and integrate the Automatic Program Generation (APG) module within the R3M Platform. It forms the core of the autonomous decision-making layer of the R3M architecture, enabling the generation and execution of robotic programs through reinforcement learning (RL) agents and skill-based orchestration. This repository bridges the gap between data-driven task generation and the real or simulated robotic environments of the R3M system.

The repository is structured around two main ROS 2 packages. The r3m_data package defines the ROS 2 communication mechanisms that enable all APG-related operations, including the .msg and .srv interfaces used across Topics and Services to manage data flow and task execution within the R3M framework. The r3m_apg package, on the other hand, includes the core functionality of the APG module: R3M use-case definitions, skill recipes for different manufacturing tasks, and MATLAB wrappers for integrating the RL-based APG agents during both training and execution phases.

At the heart of r3m_apg lies the R3M Orchestrator, a central module responsible for managing the execution environment and coordinating between different system layers. It oversees skill and program execution, RL agent training, and environment management across simulation and real-robot scenarios. The orchestrator also handles perception-driven task execution, ensuring adaptive and context-aware program generation.

By consolidating these elements, the R3M-APG repository provides a robust and scalable foundation for autonomous program generation within the R3M architecture. It enables seamless integration between learning-based decision-making, robotic control, and the communication backbone of the platform—supporting the project’s overarching goal of achieving reconfigurable, intelligent, and fully autonomous manufacturing systems.

### ros2_SimRealRobotControl Repository

The ros2_SimRealRobotControl repository has been developed as part of the R3M Project to address the challenges of reconfigurability and generalization in robotic arm programming and control. It provides a standardized framework that ensures modularity, interoperability, and seamless robot integration across different manufacturing setups. R3M-APG has been developed following the principles and architecture established in ros2_SimRealRobotControl, ensuring that robotic cells at Cranfield University and AMRC-Sheffield can be easily simulated, configured, and adapted for different tasks. By leveraging the modular design of ros2_SimRealRobotControl, R3M-APG benefits from predefined robot configurations, streamlined motion planning, and simplified deployment, making it a key component in the broader R3M initiative to enable flexible and responsive manufacturing systems.

The IFRA-Cranfield/ros2_SimRealRobotControl GitHub repository is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate seamless integration of robots into both simulated and real-world environments using ROS 2. It provides a modular setup that allows for the easy deployment of various robot configurations, along with their corresponding controllers and end-effectors, without needing to redefine core parameters. The repository is built to support multiple robots, such as the ABB IRB-120, by enabling the use of ROS 2 packages that handle simulation, control, and MoveIt!2 for robot motion planning.

This repository is ideal for robotics researchers and developers who want to streamline the process of setting up robot environments for simulation and real-world tasks. It supports both Gazebo-based simulation for testing robot setups and MoveIt!2 for controlling robots in either virtual or physical environments. By organizing key robot and end-effector parameters in a modular way, it offers a flexible approach that makes it easy to switch between different robots, configurations, or tasks, accelerating both development and testing processes in industrial automation, robotics research, and advanced manufacturing systems.
